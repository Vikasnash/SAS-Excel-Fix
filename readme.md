# SAS Viya 3.5 Excel Export Core.xml Fix

## Background

When using PROC EXPORT in SAS Viya 3.5 to generate Excel files, the resulting core.xml metadata inside the .xlsx package may contain improperly formatted created and modified date-time values. This can cause issues with compliance, audit trails, or downstream processing.

## Problem

The core.xml file generated by SAS Viya 3.5 does not always follow the proper W3CDTF date-time format.

This leads to Excel metadata showing incorrect or unreadable timestamps.

## Workaround

A Python script can be used to patch the Excel file by replacing the core.xml metadata with properly formatted values.

### Steps
- Copy the original Excel file.
- Rename the copy to .zip and extract its contents.
- Replace the docProps/core.xml file with a corrected version containing valid W3CDTF timestamps.
- Re-zip the folder and rename back to .xlsx.
- Load the corrected Excel file.
